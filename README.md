Hi, 
I am a research scientist interested in Computational Imaging, Algorithm Design, and Optics. I am affiliated with Zeiss and Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena. From 2020 to 2022 I was a postdoc in the Fibre and Waveguide Lasers Group of Jens Limpert at Helmholtz Institute and Institute of Applied Physics, Jena, where worked on XUV ptychography together with Jan Rothhardt. Moreover, I had a part-time position in the Bio-Nanoimaging Group of Rainer Heintzmann at IPHT Jena, where I worked on inverse modeling. From 2018 to 2020 I worked in the EUV Generation and Imaging group of Stefan Witte and Kjeld Eikema at Vrije Universiteit and Advanced Research Center for Nanolithography, Amsterdam. I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics under the supervision of Thomas Wilhein at Technical University Berlin.
