Hi, Iâ€™m @larsloetgering
I am a postdoctoral researcher interested in Computational Imaging, Algorithm Design, and Optics. 
Since January 2021 I am affiliated with the Fibre and Waveguide Lasers Group of Jens Limpert at Helmholtz Institute and Institute 
of Applied Physics, Jena, where I am working on XUV ptychography together with Jan Rothhardt. Moreover, I have a part-time 
position in the Bio-Nanoimaging Group of Rainer Heintzmann at IPHT Jena, where I work on inverse modeling. Previously, I worked 
in the EUV Generation and Imaging group of Stefan Witte and Kjeld Eikema at Vrije Universiteit and Advanced Research Center for 
Nanolithography, Amsterdam. I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics under the supervision of Thomas Wilhein at Technical University Berlin.
